In this experiment we created a admin user login page. Where we use four main HTML tags and css grid layout
<NAV>
<HEAD>
<FOOTER>
<MAIN>

We also implemented a theme switching feature that allows users to toggle between light mode and dark mode
Firstly i style the header
then style the navigation bar,footer,head and main
then we use DIV tag under the body tag in HTML with class named=dashboard.
Define the root variables for functioning the light and dark mode application
Create a checkbox and input word named{Dark mode}
connect these two buttons and hide the checkbox
Now test all the functionalities and our Admin page is ready
